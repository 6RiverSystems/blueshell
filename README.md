## Todo

'RUNNING' state - should we use 'RUNNING' as an optimization?

## Name

Blueshell is named for a `Skroderider` from the novel `A Fire Upon the Deep` by Vernor Vinge.
Skroderiders are intelligent plants (trees) that use mechanical constructs to give them locamotion
and short-term memory.

In other words, Blueshell is an intelligent tree. Or a tree with behavior. Get it?
